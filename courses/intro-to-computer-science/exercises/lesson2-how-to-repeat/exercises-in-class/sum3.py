# Define a procedure, sum3, that takes three
# inputs, and returns the sum of the three
# input numbers.
# To help you out, the code for sum(a,b) is below.

def sum(a,b):
  return a + b

nb1 = 1
nb2 = 2
nb3 = 3

def sum3(n1, n2, n3):
  sreturn n1 + n2 + n3

print sum3(nb1, nb2, nb3)


#print sum3(1,2,3)
#>>> 6

#print sum3(93,53,70)
#>>> 216
