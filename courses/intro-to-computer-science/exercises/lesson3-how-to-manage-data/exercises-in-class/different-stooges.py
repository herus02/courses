# We defined:

stooges = ['Moe','Larry','Curly']
print stooges

# but in some Stooges films, Curly was
# replaced by Shemp.

# Write one line of code that changes
# the value of stooges to be:

stooges_new = ['Moe','Larry','Shemp']
stooges[2] = stooges_new[2]

print stooges

# but does not create a new List
# object.
